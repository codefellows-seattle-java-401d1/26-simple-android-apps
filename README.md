## Feature Tasks  
#### Simple Counter
Create an application that displays a number and a button. The number should
increase when the button is clicked. This app proves that you can have data
stored in properties on your Activity class and manipulate the data inside a
method bound to a click listener.

#### Image Info App
Create an app that displays an Image, a paragraph (at least) of text, a next
button and a previous button. The app should allow users to cycle through images
and read summary descriptions. Pressing next should go to the next image and
it's description, pressing prev should go back. The app should display something
that shows a `(1/N)`, `(2/N)` ... indicator so users know how many items are
in the list.

* You may choose the images and descriptions to be anything you want. They can
  be your favorite movies, programming facts, a description of cities or
  whatever you want. Pick a unique theme and build an app that you'll want to
  show off!
* Your app must use a class to model the images and their descriptions.
  Use the class to manually instantiate each unique item. Add all of the items
  to an array.
* Your app should use an array of the items to cycle through what it's showing.

Follow API-level 19 conventions to get access to the app resources and convert
an id into an integer:

```
Drawable pic = getResources().getDrawable(cat.drawableId);
picture.setImageDrawable(pic);
```

## Documentation
Create a directory called `screenshots` in the root of your project. Take a
screenshot of each app you've created. Use markdown to render the screenshots
in your README.

For reference, here's the markdown syntax to render an image in a page:

```
![image description](screenshots/path_to_screenshot_file.png)
```

## Stretch Goals
Design the Score Keeper app to have two sets of numbers and
buttons. Make it a tool someone would use if they were keeping track of
a sports game. Feel free to customize the buttons however you want to make it
easy for someone to input a score for the sport, and allow them to have a way
to correct any mistakes they make when entering a score.
