Denver then went on to win the game in overtime 23-20 on a field goal that some Browns fans, to this day, insist sailed wide of the upright."),

However, he'll forever be remembered for a heart-wrenching fumble at Denver's three-yard line late in the fourth quarter. Byner had what seemed to be a clear path to the end zone to score what would have been a game-tying touchdown, and Cleveland had its heart broken again, just a year after John Elway did it with The Drive."),

In the deciding fifth game of their playoff series, Craig Ehlo scored on a layup to give Cleveland a one-point lead with three seconds remaining only to see Jordan (pictured in 1991) bury a series-deciding jumper over him on the final play of the game.

His decision to move the storied Browns franchise to Baltimore, Md., for the start of the 1996 NFL season led to angry protests, lawsuits and ultimately the NFL allowing the team to keep its name, team colors and history intact for a new incarnation of the franchise three seasons later."),

More recently, the Indians blew a 3-1 lead to the Boston Red Sox in the 2007 ALCS and still have not returned to the World Series since 1997.
